Hello!

I'm a Ph.D. student from University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, US. I am pursuing my Ph.D. of Statistics in [Statistics Department](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics "Statistics department at UCSC") at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/ "University of California, Santa Cruz Homepage").

My research focus on Bayesian Statistics, Variational Inference, Nonparameteric Method and Graph Model. I am also interested in Bayesian deep learning such as Deep Gaussian Process, Bayesian Neural Network and so on. 

I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") and it's currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). It doubles as my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume "Mark Berger's Resume") and a place to post guides, code fragments, thoughts and anything else that's interesting.

Please feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a> me if you have any questions or comments.
